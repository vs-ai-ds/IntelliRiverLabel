# Evaluation Plan

## Inputs used
Primary test input:
- `assets/problem/Problem_1_river.wkt` (unit: pt)

Optional additional tests:
- synthetic polygons generated by the training script

## Baselines
1) Centroid placement (no rotation)
2) Centroid placement (with rotation from PCA)
3) Random feasible point + angle

## Metrics (Phase A)
- success: placement feasible inside safe region (bool)
- min_clearance_pt: minimum distance from label bbox to river boundary
- fit_margin_ratio: available span / required label width
- readability_angle_penalty: 0..1 penalty based on orientation

## Metrics (Phase B)
- segment_clearance_min_pt
- curvature_total_deg
- straightness_ratio

## Deliverables for judging
- before/after images on the provided river
- debug overlays showing why the chosen placement is best
- short metrics report comparing baseline vs our approach
